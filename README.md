# Ember Components

A convenient Atom package for Ember developers.

See all controllers and components that are rendering your current component at the bottom of the currently opened template and go to source upon click.

# Installation

```bash
$ apm install atom-ember-components
```

# Usage

After installation, ensure you open atom in your app/ directory or one level above your app/ directory. This package currently only works with the pods structure.

After opening any component `template.hbs` or `component.js` you should then see a list of all components that are rendering the current component at the bottom of the file.

If you see unexpected behavior, please file a bug and I'll address it ASAP.
